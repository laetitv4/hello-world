# hello-world
first round at learning how to code! 
Laetitia is latin for happiness! I am the oldest of 4 whose maternal instincts have extended beyond familial ties. I show love through food, words of affirmation, and presents! 

in my free time I enjoy making crepes, listening to old makossa, and dreaming up the next adventure! Ever since moving to Cincy, I have not been as active. i am now looking for opportunities to volunteer and be active in YP boards.
